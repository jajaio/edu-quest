I've been slowly modifying my old game "Aplhaquest" to teach
new programmers how to make a Text-Based RPG. I think that
it's important to leave entries while you're doing your
work, so you can keep tabs of your learning. More entries
will be logged in the following days.

It's a pain to rewrite everything. I plan to make this game
as basic and simple as possible, and use it as a tool to
make more creative things. I'm renaming the town to be the
hub, renaming classes to be generic titles, etc. I want to
change the naming of the field, but I don't know what to
change it to. I want to rename the town and other things
because I don't want people to think that it has to be
a town. It could be a bedroom, or maybe even a space 
station. Anything creative. I don't want the structure
of Alphaquest to limit any gameplay. I also plan to
rework a lot of my old freshman year code to be much
cleaner and more productive. More on that later.
