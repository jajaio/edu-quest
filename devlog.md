I've been slowly modifying my old game "Aplhaquest" to teach
new programmers how to make a Text-Based RPG. I think that
it's important to leave entries while you're doing your
work, so you can keep tabs of your learning. More entries
will be logged in the following days.

It's a pain to rewrite everything. I plan to make this game
as basic and simple as possible, and use it as a tool to
make more creative things. I'm renaming the town to be the
hub, renaming classes to be generic titles, etc. I want to
change the naming of the field, but I don't know what to
change it to. I want to rename the town and other things
because I don't want people to think that it has to be
a town. It could be a bedroom, or maybe even a space 
station. Anything creative. I don't want the structure
of Alphaquest to limit any gameplay. I also plan to
rework a lot of my old freshman year code to be much
cleaner and more productive. More on that later.

Working on this because I'm jacked on caffine and have
nothing better to do. For some reason when the game starts
it runs the attack and heal animation, and I found that 
it's referencing the attanim=playerattanim() or whatever
it's called in the classes.py file. Why is this happening?
I'm just defining the var as a function, so why does it 
run within the class? I'll ask Cole about it when 
school starts back up.
